### Full-Stack Engineer

I love to build things that **have to work** in real-time. 

I started in the world of E-commerce and Direct Selling. Long before the current AI wave, I was **designing web pages** and building the infrastructure for **commission-heavy platforms**. I’ve spent plenty of time in the trenches with **third-party payment integrations and complex business logic-experience** that taught me how to **build for reliability and scale**. 

My most recent work have been diving deep into the intersection of **audio streams and applied LLMs**. I spend most of my time making sure that **thousands of hours of call center conversations into insightful live analytical dashboards** with near zero issues. 

**_I’m enjoy owning the full lifecycle of a feature_**, going from feature docs to functional prototypes, getting user feedback, reiterating on the work constantly so that an stable production release can go live ASAP.

#### Work
- **_Product_** : (blog incoming...)
  - **Real-Time Compliance Assistant** that uses self-hosted LLMs (Qwen3, Gemma3, etc.) using vLLM and fine-tuned BERT to assist call center associate in real time and make sure they are compliant thus improving their call quality metrics.
  - **Automated Call Quality Scoring** feature using similar self hosted LLMs (Qwen3 Reasoning, etc.). The feature converts an unstructured quality sheet from supervisor and then analyze call transcripts and score based on those scorecard. User gets the result with visually appealing analytics dashboard.
  - **Chatbot**: I was required to build natural language chatbot that uses **Function/Tool Calling + Hybrid RAG** (Next.js, pgvector) so that **let users can query in plain English the analytics data stored in database and files**.
- **_Performance Engineering (Latency & Stream Processing)_**: Optimized the pipeline to move audio from **ASR to the UI** including full analytical processing in near real-time. This meant architecting a concurrent system that could handle transcription and heavy LLM-based analysis without blocking the data stream or lagging the dashboard, ensuring stakeholders saw insights while the call was still live.
- **_Enterprise Security (Hardened Infrastructure)_**: Security was a baseline requirement. I’ve led the effort to made our products **PCI, SOC2, GDPR, and HIPAA compliant**, which involved more than just checking boxes. Implementing fine-grained **RBAC**, enterprise **SSO (SAML/OIDC)** to ensure sensitive conversational data remained protected, especially in self-hosted or on-premise environments.
