### Full-Stack Engineer | Real-Time Speech AI

I love to build things that **have to work** in real-time. Lately, that’s meant diving deep into the intersection of audio streams and applied LLMs. I spend most of my time figuring out how to turn thousands of hours of messy voice data into something a business can actually use whether that’s an automated compliance agent or a live analytics dashboard.

I’m comfortable owning the full lifecycle of a feature. I’d rather ship a functional prototype to get real customer feedback than spend weeks over-engineering a spec that might change. Fortunately, while doing that I got to make our app PCI compliant, implement SSO and DRM for enterprise clients and various other usual stuff.

#### Most Recent Work
- _Real-Time Audio & Compliance_: I handle the low-latency plumbing: WebSockets, Deepgram, and custom redaction, topic detection, script deviation. I built a compliance assistant that uses self-hosted LLMs (Qwen, Gemma, etc.) using vLLM and fine-tuned BERT to assist call center associate in real time and make sure they are compliant thus improving their call quality metrics.
- _Applied AI_: Past simple API calls, I was required to build natural language chatbot for that uses Function Calling + RAG (Next.js, pgvector) to build tools that let non-technical users query their own data in plain English.
- _Performance Engineering_: Who likes slow software ? Nobody. So when a dashboard lags, I was required to dig into API logs, MongoDB indexing and caching layers to get it back to being responsive and then improve current architecture.
- _Security_: Since most of my work was deployed for enterprises security was not optional and for various compliance requirements like PCI, SOC, GDPR, I was required to made proper app modifications and add proper security checks in various layers of app.

#### Where it started
I started in the world of E-commerce and Direct Selling. Long before the current AI wave, I was **designing web pages** and building the infrastructure for **commission-heavy platforms**. I’ve spent plenty of time in the trenches with **third-party payment integrations and complex business logic-experience** that taught me how to **build for reliability and scale**.
